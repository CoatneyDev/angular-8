# Angular 8 Skeleton

By Matthew Coatney (CoatneyDEV)

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 8.0.6.

Skeleton is an Angular 8 template which includes implementations of these technologies:
+ [AngularFire](https://github.com/angular/angularfire2)
+ [NGRX](https://ngrx.io/)
+ [AngularMaterial](https://material.angular.io/)
+ [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)


## Getting Started
Start by modifying the environment.example.ts file with project specific info, then place it in an environments folder. Next, complete the project configuration in app.config

+ [Environment](src\environment.example.ts)
+ [Application](src\app\configs\app.config.ts)

## Custom Theming

A custom theme [Watermelon](src\assets\themes\watermelon.scss) is provided by default including two custom color swatches: Emerald and Coral.
Angular Material and Bulma are integrated together for a polished non-cookie cutter look.

## User Accounts

Basic authentication and user account creation is implemented through Firestore (via Firebase/AngularFire) and includes scaffolding for user profiles and a member dashboard system.
